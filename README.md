This is a College Technical Fest Concetto 2023's Competition in which I used HiRISE Dataset that contains 8 different classes of mars surface image. The main challenge was that the given dataset is so imbalanced that getting a great accuracy is critical. I did Image Classification on this dataset using Deep Learning, I used different models such as **ShuffleNetV2**, **EfficientNet**, **MobileNet** and also developed a **Custom CNN Model** from scratch using **Python** and **Pytorch**. I built **Dataloader, Pre-processing Dataset, Data Augmentation, Warm Epochs, Learning Scheduler** from scratch using **Python** and **Pytorch**. I also implemented and **used different losses for Image Classification such as Categorical Cross-entropy, Cosine Loss, Focal Cosine Loss, Focal Loss** from different research papers to get better accuracy.
