* This is a College Technical Fest Concetto 2023's Competition in which we used HiRISE Dataset that contains 8 different classes of mars surface image. We were the first in the competition.
* The main challenge was that the given dataset is so imbalanced that getting a great accuracy is critical.
* We did Image Classification on this dataset using Deep Learning, we used different models such as **ShuffleNetV2**, **EfficientNet**, **MobileNet** and also developed a **Custom CNN Model** from scratch using **Python** and **Pytorch**.
* We built **Dataloader, Pre-processing Dataset, Data Augmentation, Warm Epochs, Learning Scheduler** from scratch using **Python** and **Pytorch**.
* We also implemented and **used different losses for Image Classification such as Categorical Cross-entropy, Cosine Loss, Focal Cosine Loss, Focal Loss** from different research papers to get better accuracy.
* We also built my own code to store my model's weights for each epoch.
* We also created a code so you can see your results of each epoch stored in a **Google Doc** that **you can access through your phone from anywhere in the world.**
